# Homework3 JavaScript: Password Generator Overview

## Description

I created a password generator.  Upon clicking the 'Generate Password' button, the user is prompted to give a password length between 8 and 128 characters.  Then, the user gets the choice of whether to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.  After each user selection, the user confirms their choice.  The user must select at least one character type of they have to reconfirm all their choices.  Once a user has satisfied all requirements, a password is generated and written to the page.
